To enable AI agents to populate this document effectively, I have added "Agent Directives" to each section. These directives serve as prompt-engineering constraints to ensure the agent provides structured, data-backed technical analysis rather than generic summaries.
[Incident ID] - Autonomous Root Cause Analysis
Metadata (Auto-Generated)
Incident ID: {{incident_id}}
Primary System: {{impacted_service_name}}
Detection Source: {{alerting_source_e.g._Prometheus_CloudWatch}}
Agent Version: {{agent_version_id}}
Status: Pending Human Review
1. Executive Summary
Agent Instruction: Summarize the incident in under 150 words. Focus on the Primary Trigger and the Ultimate Resolution. Avoid jargon in the first sentence for stakeholder readability.
{{summary_text}}
2. Impact & Scope Analysis
Agent Instruction: Query observability APIs (Datadog/NewRelic/CloudWatch) to provide hard numbers. Specifically identify the blast radius.
Service(s) Affected: {{list_affected_microservices}}
Error Rate Peak: {{peak_error_percentage}}%
Latency Impact: {{p99_latency_increase}}ms
Cloud Resources Affected: {{e.g._AWS_RDS_instance_id_or_K8s_Namespace}}
User Impact: {{count_of_4xx_5xx_responses}} total failed requests.
3. Autonomous Troubleshooting Timeline (UTC)
Agent Instruction: Reconstruct the timeline based on your internal execution logs and system event logs. Use ISO 8601 format. Match system alerts to your autonomous actions.
Timestamp	Event/Action	Source/Component
{{T1}}	Incident Start: First deviation from baseline detected.	{{metric_name}}
{{T2}}	Detection: Automated alert triggered.	{{alert_rule_id}}
{{T3}}	Agent Engagement: Autonomous diagnosis started.	{{agent_id}}
{{T4}}	Hypothesis Formed: {{describe_first_hypothesis}}	Agent Reasoning
{{T5}}	Mitigation Applied: {{describe_action_e.g._Restart_Pod}}	Agent Action
{{T6}}	Verification: Metrics returned to baseline.	{{metric_name}}
4. Root Cause Analysis (The 5 Whys)
Agent Instruction: Use logical chaining. Ensure the "Final Root Cause" is a systemic failure (e.g., a missing policy or lack of circuit breaker) rather than just a "human error" or "temporary glitch."
Direct Symptom: {{why_1}}
Immediate Cause: {{why_2}}
Contributory Factor: {{why_3}}
Underlying Process Gap: {{why_4}}
Root Cause: {{final_systemic_root_cause}}
5. Technical Evidence & Logs
Agent Instruction: Attach the specific log snippets or trace IDs that confirmed your hypothesis. If Cloud Infrastructure changed (IaC), provide the diff or the event log.
Log Snippet:
code
Text
{{insert_critical_log_lines}}
Trace ID: {{distributed_trace_link_or_id}}
Infrastructure Diff: {{terraform_or_k8s_spec_changes_detected}}
6. Autonomous Mitigation vs. Permanent Fixes
Agent Instruction: Differentiate between the "Band-aid" the agent applied and the "Permanent Surgery" a human engineer must perform.
🛠 Actions Taken by Agent (Mitigation)
{{action_1}} (e.g., Flushed Redis Cache)
{{action_2}} (e.g., Scaled EKS Replicas from 3 to 10)
📋 Recommended Permanent Actions (Prevention)
Infrastructure: {{e.g._Update_HPA_targets_in_Terraform}}
Application: {{e.g._Implement_exponential_backoff_on_Database_client}}
Monitoring: {{e.g._Add_anomaly_detection_alert_for_memory_leak_patterns}}
7. Agent Confidence Score & Reasoning
Agent Instruction: Self-assess the accuracy of this RCA. If confidence is below 80%, flag specific "Unknowns" for the human reviewer.
Confidence Score: {{0-100}}%
Unknowns/Assumptions: {{describe_any_data_gaps_or_ambiguities}}
How to use this for your AI Team:
System Prompt: Feed the agent the "Agent Instructions" as part of its system prompt when it enters the "Reporting Phase" of its workflow.
Data Extraction: The agent should use tool-calling (Function Calling) to fetch the variables inside the {{double_brackets}}.
Validation: Use a secondary LLM "Critic" agent to read the generated RCA against the raw logs to ensure no hallucinations occurred in the Timeline or Technical Evidence sections.

**8. Automation & Remediation Spec (Machine Readable)**
*Directive: Provide executable commands and queries for the Remediation Agent.*

TARGET_URL: {{url_to_test}}
REPRODUCTION_SCENARIO: {{puppeteer_scenario_description}}
REMEDIATION_COMMAND: {{gcloud_or_kubectl_command}}
VALIDATION_QUERY: {{monitoring_query}}
VALIDATION_THRESHOLD: {{success_criteria}}
