generate manifest.json and instructions.json for all MATs agents.
then build the master capability json to be used in master orchestrator (orchestrator_adk). Acccordingly modify the agent.py file for all the MATs agents and load the capabilities from the newly generated manifest.json.

since now MATs agents are ready, all sub agents and MCP servers are ready, lets integrate @ui with @orchestrator_adk. This integration will be already in place only thing to check is whether MAT agents are also integrated in-terms of capability. if not then we need to update the orchestrator_adk to include the MAT agents. @agent.py for the orchestrator_adk needs to be updated inorder to correctly route the request to the agents. the agentic capability should be built from the orchestrator_adk/master_agent_registry.json. This new file needs to be generated from the agent_registry.json + manifest.json of mats-orchestrator agent.  just like @generic_agent_registry.json create a new file to generate the orchestrator_adk/master_agent_registry.json

Once this is completed, when user input is received through the UI, according to the intent of the user prompt, orchestrator_adk checks the agentic capability and sends the request to @mats-orchestrator or any other sub agent in sub_agents. 


Do this only after the above task is completed.
In Phoenix observability, many data fields are missing. Inorder to do effective observability, we need to add many data fields. 
Phoenix observability needs to be integarted into all the agents. including @orchestrator_adk, @mats-orchestrator, @mats-sre-agent, @mats-investigator-agent, @mats-architect-agent, @mats-sre-agent, @mats-investigator-agent, @mats-architect-agent, all @sub_agents and @mcp_servers
